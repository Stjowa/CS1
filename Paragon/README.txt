This was a project programmed by me in my AP Computer Science class in high school as a final project for the class. It is written in the programming language Java. This is based off the game Galaga which Namco originally made. I take no criedt for the idea behind the game but only used it to test my talents that I learned in the class. I never fully finished the game but this is the program I did finish in the 2 weeks I was given.
