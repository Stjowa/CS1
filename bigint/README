This bigint class was assigned to the class as a project to understand operator overloading.

Anything used in this class was developed by myself and would encourage those that have questions to go ahead and send me an email and I will be more than happy to try to assist anyone with any questions concerning this project or using it for other purposes outside of the classroom.

Do not copy my code for your own project but use it as a guideline to help you create your own code. I appreciate those that do not copy this and those that are using this for help.

Programmed by Stephen Walentik.
