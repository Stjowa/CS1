All of these programs are programmed by me, Stephen Walentik. Most of 
these have been used for my Computer Science class with the exception 
of a few that were used in the past or to future my knowledge with the 
topics taught in my class. I would ask you not to copy from my code 
but to use it as a learning experience and to future YOUR knowledge in 
programming. If you must use my code though please give the credit 
where it is due. Once again, if you must use my code though please 
give the credit where it is due.
